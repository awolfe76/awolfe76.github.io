      <p>My first real IT job was in <a href="#masdmdm" id="tdec">Oakland, MD</a> with The Data Entry Company (TDEC). It was close to home, Corriganville, MD. I wrote some VB (only a little) and redesigned their website (long gone). Then I got married and moved to <a href="#englaskl" id="england">England</a>. It's a long story, maybe a blog post sometime. But, while there I did some print design, posters, flyers, newsletters. A ~40&deg;, rainy 4<sup>th</sup> of July and it was time to come home again. At least back in the U.S. I got a job with Embedded Systems Design in <a href="#esdeorwi" id="esd">Laurel, MD</a>. Then my wife and I decided we wanted be even warmer. I took a position with Lockheed Martin ... <a href="#lockiuowe" id="lockheed">Orlando, FL</a> here we come. Then we were home sick again. So back home again, at least pretty close, <a href="#uscglkwek" id="uscg">Martinsburg, WV</a> working for Perot Systems/Dell/General Dynamics (surived several contract negotiations) on contract with the Coast Guard. And now finally (for good I swear) in <a href="#fcciwen" id="fcc">Chambersburg, PA</a> working as a government employee for the FCC.</p>
