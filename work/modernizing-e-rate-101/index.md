The E-Rate program has helped connect nearly all U.S. schools and libraries to affordable telecommunications services.

I was brought in by the E-Rate program to design and build a one page site to highlight the importance of modernizing the E-Rate program. The old rules were written "nearly two decades ago" when "pagers were as popular as cell phones are today".

Using several visualizations the site quickly shows that the program needs updated through the number of funded schools and libraries, along with the numbers of students, schools and libraries that would benefit from a simple change.

I built the site using Jekyll and with HighCharts.js for the visualizations.
